Local
------------
The local part is a "native" Java library that aims to implement the Bitorrent protocol and many of its extensions with Java code.

Remote
------------
The remote part is a connector that wraps many other popular Bitorrent client APIs. The remote library can be used to control clients such
as uTorrent or Transmission.
