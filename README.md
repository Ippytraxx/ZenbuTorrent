ZenbuTorrent
=============
A powerful, two-part Java torrent library with minimal dependencies.

Info
============
ZenbuTorrent is divided into two main parts, local and remote. Both of these are WIP and are not complete yet.

Local
------------
The local part is a "native" Java library that aims to implement the Bitorrent protocol and many of its extensions with Java code.

Remote
------------
The remote part is a connector that wraps many other popular Bitorrent client APIs. The remote library can be used to control clients such
as uTorrent or Transmission.
